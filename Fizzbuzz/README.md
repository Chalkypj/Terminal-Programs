# FizzBuzz Program

##### This is a basic FizzBuzz Program that prints to the terminal the number plus Fizz if it is divisible by 3, plus Buzz if it is divisible by 5 and FizzBuzz if it is divisible by 3 and 5. This is implimented here on the numbers from 0 - 100.

#### To run this program, make sure you have python installed (I wrote this in python 3.11.5). Open a terminal in the directory where 'fizzbuzz.py' resides and enter 'python.exe fizzbuzz.py'
